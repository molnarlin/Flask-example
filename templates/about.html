        Thorin and Company were a group of thirteen Dwarves, the Wizard Gandalf, and the Hobbit Bilbo 
        Baggins, led by Thorin II in TA 2941. Their purpose was to regain the lost Dwarven kingdom of 
        the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which 
        kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's 
        grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering 
        that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to 
        add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. 
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn 
        Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky
         number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill 
         into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>Thorin II "Oakenshield", eventually called King under the Mountain or Mountain King,
                 was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of 
                King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was best known for his deeds as 
                leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it 
                back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle 
                of Five Armies.</p>

            <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. 
                They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of 
                Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of 
                the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. 
                Óin's uncle was Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. Óin fought in the Battle of 
                Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on 
                the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the 
                Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. 
                Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, 
                as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five
                 Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with 
                 many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger 
            child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin. In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in 
            the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it 
            is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old. In TA 2879, in the 
            Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In 
            March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, 
            pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf 
            mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would 
            never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

        <h3>Gandalf</h3>
        <p>
            Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by 
            Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the 
            Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë,
             Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda, yet his 
             ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the 
             Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair 
             visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the 
             example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing 
             those who listened to him out of despair.
